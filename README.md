## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js, verify it is installed by running:
  ```
  npm -v
  ```
- **Webpack**: This repository uses Webpack as the module bundler.

### Installation 💿

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snap-camera-kit-template.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd snap-camera-kit-template
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration ⚙️

1. In `src/config.js`, update your Camera Kit credentials:
   ```javascript
   const LENS_ID = "your-lens-id"
   const GROUP_ID = "your-group-id"
   const API_TOKEN = "your-api-token"
   ```
   You can obtain these credentials from [Snap's Camera Kit Dashboard](https://camera-kit.snapchat.com/).

### Local Testing 🔍

To test the project locally:

1. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

   This will launch a local server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:9000`. Open the URL in your browser to test the application.

   Using webpack, you can also access the local server with https on your mobile devices at `https://yourIPAddress:9000`. This will be provided on your terminal by webpack.

2. Make changes to the code, and the server will automatically reload the app to reflect your updates.

### Building for Production 🏗️

To create a production-ready build, run:

```
npm run build
```

The optimized output will be stored in the `docs` directory, ready for deployment.

## Browser Support 🌐

- Chrome (desktop & mobile) - Recommended ✅
- Safari (iOS 14.5+) 📱
- Firefox (desktop & mobile) 🦊
- Edge (Chromium-based) 🌍

Note: For optimal AR experience, using Chrome on mobile devices is recommended.

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues ⚠️

- **Camera not working on mobile** 📱:
  - Ensure you're using the HTTPS URL provided by webpack
  - Check if camera permissions are granted
  - Verify you're using a supported browser
- **Lens not loading** 🎭:
  - Verify your Camera Kit credentials are correct
  - Check browser console for specific error messages
  - Ensure your lens is published and active
- **Recording issues** 🎬:
  - Check if device has sufficient storage
  - Ensure browser supports MediaRecorder API
  - Verify required permissions are granted

### Mobile Debugging 🐛

To debug on mobile devices:

1. Connect your mobile device to your computer via USB
2. Enable USB debugging on your Android device or trust the computer on your iOS device
3. On Chrome desktop, navigate to `chrome://inspect`
4. Find your device and the web page under "Remote Target"
5. Click "inspect" to open Chrome DevTools for your mobile device
6. You can now see console logs and debug your mobile web app

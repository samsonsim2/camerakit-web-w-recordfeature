## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 📋

- Node.js (v14 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Camera Kit credentials from Snap

> 💡 **New to Node.js?**
>
> 1. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
> 2. After installation, open your terminal/command prompt
> 3. Verify installation by typing:
>    ```bash
>    node --version
>    npm --version
>    ```
>    Both commands should show version numbers

### Installation 💿

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd camerakit-web-w-recordfeature
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure Camera Kit credentials:
   Create `src/config.js` with your credentials:

```javascript
export const CONFIG = {
  LENS_ID: "__LENS_ID__",
  GROUP_ID: "__GROUP_ID__",
  API_TOKEN: "__API_TOKEN__",
}
```

### Development 🔧

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Webpack will start a development server with HTTPS enabled.
You'll see two URLs in the terminal:

- Local: `https://localhost:9000`
- Network: `https://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:9000` (for mobile devices)

To test on your mobile device, use the Network URL shown in your terminal.

⚠️ **Notes**:

- Your mobile device must be on the same WiFi network as your computer
- Accept the self-signed certificate warning in your browser when testing
- HTTPS is required for camera access on mobile devices

### Production Build 🏗️

Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Output will be in the `build` directory.

### Deployment on Vercel 🚀

> 💡 **New to Vercel?**  
> Vercel is a platform that makes it easy to deploy websites. You'll need:
>
> 1. A GitHub account - [Sign up here](https://github.com/signup)
> 2. Your project code pushed to GitHub
> 3. A Vercel account (you can sign up with your GitHub account)

To deploy securely on Vercel without exposing your Camera Kit credentials:

1. Create a Vercel account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)

   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Choose "Continue with GitHub"
   - Follow the authorization steps

2. Import your GitHub repository:

   - Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
   - Select your repository
   - Click "Import" and wait for deployment to complete

⚠️ **Security Note**:

- Using environment variables on Vercel keeps your credentials secure
- Never commit actual credentials to your repository
- Keep your local `config.js` for development, Vercel will use its own version in production

## Browser Support 🌐

- Chrome (latest) ✅
- Firefox (latest) 🦊
- Safari (iOS 14.5+) 📱
- Edge (latest) 🌍

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### Common Issues ⚠️

1. **Build Errors**:

   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check webpack configuration
   - Verify file paths in imports

2. **Camera Issues**:

   - Use HTTPS for camera access
   - Grant camera permissions
   - Check browser compatibility

3. **Recording Issues**:
   - Ensure sufficient device storage
   - Check MediaRecorder support
   - Verify permissions
